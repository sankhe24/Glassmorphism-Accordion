 Glassmorphism Accordion UI
This project features a sleek and interactive accordion-style UI with a glassmorphism design. It uses 3D animation effects to reveal hidden content when you click on each accordion item. Perfect for showcasing details in a modern, stylish way.

Features:
Glassmorphism Design: Soft, blurred background and semi-transparent elements for a clean look.
Smooth Transitions: Each accordion item smoothly expands and collapses.
Responsive: Adapts to different screen sizes.
Easy to Customize: Swap out images, change text, and modify styles as needed.


Technologies Used:
HTML5: Structure of the content.
CSS3: Styling, glassmorphism effect, animations, and transitions.
JavaScript: Handles the interactive accordion behavior.
Font Awesome: For icons.


How to Use:
Accordion Structure: Each item contains a header and a body. The body is hidden initially and expands upon clicking the header.
Customization:
Update the background image in the CSS to your own.
Edit text content in the HTML inside the .body divs.
Change the header titles as needed.
Demo:
Simply copy the code into an HTML file and open it in your browser to see it in action.
